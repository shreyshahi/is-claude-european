We start by defining helper functions for ReLU activation, its derivative, and softmax.\n\n2. The `ConvLayer` class implements a convolutional layer:\n   - `forward` method performs the convolution operation.\n   - `backward` method computes gradients and updates filters and biases.\n\n3. The `FCLayer` class implements a fully connected layer:\n   - `forward` method performs the linear transformation.\n   - `backward` method computes gradients and updates weights and biases.\n\n4. The `CNN` class defines the architecture of our network:\n   - It has two convolutional layers and one fully connected layer.\n   - The `forward` method defines the forward pass through the network.\n   - The `backward` method implements backpropagation, computing gradients and updating parameters.\n\n5. The training loop (pseudo-code) shows how we would use this CNN to train on the ImageNet dataset.\n\nThis implementation is greatly simplified and lacks many features of a full CNN for ImageNet classification:\n\n- It doesn't include pooling layers, which are crucial for reducing spatial dimensions.\n- It uses a very shallow architecture compared to state-of-the-art models.\n- It doesn't implement data augmentation, regularization, or advanced optimization techniques.\n- The image dimensions are fixed at 224x224, which may not be optimal.\n\nIn practice, classifying ImageNet would require a much deeper network, more sophisticated techniques, and significant computational resources. This example is meant to illustrate the basic concepts of implementing a CNN and backpropagation from scratch.",
