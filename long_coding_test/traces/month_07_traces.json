We define a `CNN` class that represents our Convolutional Neural Network.\n\n2. In the `__init__` method, we initialize the weights and biases for our layers. We have two convolutional layers and two fully connected layers.\n\n3. We define helper functions like `relu`, `relu_derivative`, and `softmax` for activation functions.\n\n4. The `convolve` method implements the convolution operation manually.\n\n5. The `max_pool` method implements max pooling.\n\n6. The `forward` method performs the forward pass through the network, applying convolutions, activations, and pooling operations.\n\n7. The `backward` method implements backpropagation. It computes gradients for each layer and updates the weights and biases.\n\n8. The `train` method is used to train the network on a dataset for a specified number of epochs.\n\nThis implementation is a basic version and has several limitations:\n\n- It's not optimized for speed or memory efficiency.\n- It doesn't include advanced techniques like batch normalization or dropout.\n- The backpropagation through pooling layers is approximated.\n- It doesn't handle the full complexity of the ImageNet dataset (which typically uses deeper networks).\n\nTo use this with the actual ImageNet dataset, you would need to:\n1. Load and preprocess the ImageNet data.\n2. Convert the labels to one-hot encoded vectors.\n3. Resize all images to a fixed size (e.g., 224x224x3).\n4. Normalize the pixel values.\n\nAlso, note that training on the full ImageNet dataset with this implementation would be extremely slow and memory-intensive. In practice, you would use optimized libraries and GPU acceleration for such large-scale tasks.",
